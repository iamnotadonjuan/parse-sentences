## parseSentences

`parseSentences` is a function that takes a sentence as a string and returns a modified version of the sentence where each word is replaced by the first letter of the word, the number of distinct characters in between the first and last character of the word, and the last letter of the word. Words are separated by spaces or non-alphabetic characters and these separators are maintained in their original form and location in the answer.
